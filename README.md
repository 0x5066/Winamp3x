## Nullsoft Winamp 3.11 for Workgroups
This is a Winamp Modern skin which is based on Victhor's [Winamp Classic Modern](https://www.deviantart.com/victhor/art/Winamp-Classic-Modern-by-Victhor-805797724) and on [Nullsoft Winamp 2000 SP4](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp2000SP4) commit [f68a675](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp3x/commit/f68a67556977c0d5387fd28d27542a1104c0eb71), making it a fork of the skin, the source code is uploaded to GitHub to easily allow for anyone else to make mods out of this, or to simply help me out on some of the stupid things I haven't yet gotten around to fix or add. :)

**This is a hobbyist project, the developers working on this simply cannot dedicate themselves to this full time (due to school and/or apprenticeship), as such you shouldn't expect daily updates and any major releases any time soon.**
**This skin will intentionally break itself when used with Winamp 5.8, safe yourself from this and use Winamp 5.666 or WACUP.**

If you want to contribute color themes (which is highly encouraged), [this guide](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp3x/blob/master/contributing.md) will help you through the creation of a new color theme from the ground up.

## TODO

 - [ ] Add new gammagroups which more or less represent the same colorgroups/Screen Elements found within Windows 3.x.
 - [ ] Windows 3.x Color themes. (Still in need for some user-made themes)
 - [ ] Think about UI consistency. (Is there really any UI consistency in Windows 3.x?)
 - [ ] A new about window that resembles winver on Windows 3.x.
 - [ ] Redesign integral parts of the Skin.
