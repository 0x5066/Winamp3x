# Special thanks goes towards to...
...those that have helped me build this thing and [Winamp2000SP4](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp2000SP4) for quite some time now.
These people are:

- [Darren Owen (DrO)](https://getwacup.com/) for providing some small feedback whenever he could and for tracking down the playlist crash issue WCM based skins have experienced.
- [Victhor](https://www.deviantart.com/victhor) for being patient with me and giving me multiple tips and hints on how things are done in the realm of WasabiXML (as well as providing the Winamp/WACUP detection)
- Juanus who has been my hype man since the beginning or so, and providing feedback as well.
- Aquafox, Omega/randomegbert and Fixator10 for showing interest in the development as well as using it.
- Fixator10 for discovering a crucial bug that has the potential to break the skin in a horrifying way.
- [jberg](https://github.com/jberg) for collabing with me on a whim.
- [Raildriver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0bCOpoYJQuDpPIi2d_csA) who, despite being a firm believer of using nothing but WMP to play anything (and using YouTube for music), provided feedback on UI suggestions.
- [Midori Mizuno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIe4T4qHKDJXRc8Djm7WQ6g/) for giving me feedback on what set of icons I should use for the thinger and approving of those changes.
- Mirzi, who helped me make the Nullsoft Winamp 2000 SP4 v1.2 promotion image a lot better than what I had in mind and for improving the creation of future color schemes for the visualizer, aswell as being the co-developer of Winamp3x, reworking UI elements and so much more, check out [WinampXP](https://github.com/mirzi1/WinampXP) if you want a accurate Windows XP skin!
- [Justin Frankel](http://1014.org/) for coming up with Winamp in the first place.
- Nullsoft for giving us the nightmare that is the infamous Modern Skin engine.
- And everyone else on the [WACUP forums](https://getwacup.com/community/index.php)/[discord](https://discord.gg/5pVTdbj) who watched me develop this thing in pure agony and despair at times. :)
- Anyone else that is watching this evolve from the distance.
- Last but not least, to those who have [starred](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp3x/stargazers) and are [watching](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp3x/watchers) this project.
